Add to Cart Button Generator :)

## Demo

[Add to Cart Button Generator](https://samlshea.github.io/AddtoCartButtonGenerator)


## About

This project was created for a Javascript course. I wanted to make a usable web app for Shopify Gurus or Shopify Merchants who are not adept at html/css to generate css to change the color and size of the add to cart button on their Shopify theme.

## Known Limitations

### Desktop Only

This app generates css with a media query making it so it only changes the button styles on desktop. This was due to not having enough time to figure out how to make the button responsive for each theme.

### Preset/hardcoded sizes (width)

I would like to eventually find a way to have more dynamic/ responsive size options. Right now the width is set in pixels with 4 predefined options

### Limited style options

This app only adds color, background-colour, and width(px) styles. It does not allow for the customization of hover effects, animations, pointer types, font styles, padding, or anything else. Maybe more could be added in the future?


### Limited to free Shopify Supported themes

Since there is no universal add to cart button selector it would be impossible to include all themes. More can be added if requested.
